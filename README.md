Hello Everyone, Earlier I had implemented a basic chess problem in C language using backtracking, where the focus was on recursively exploring possible moves and undoing them to find valid solutions. Building on that foundation, I later extended the same core idea into a full chess-playing AI in JavaScript. In this project, the chessboard is treated as a game state, and for every move, all possible future board states are generated recursively. The AI uses the Minimax algorithm with Alpha–Beta pruning, which is an optimized form of backtracking, to evaluate moves several steps ahead while assuming the opponent also plays optimally. Instead of just checking for valid moves, the system assigns scores to board positions based on piece values and strategically chooses the best move. This progression from simple backtracking in C to an optimized decision-making AI demonstrates my understanding of recursion, state-space search, and game theory concepts.
